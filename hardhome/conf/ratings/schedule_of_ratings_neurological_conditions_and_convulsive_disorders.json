It provides criteria for levels of impairment for each facet, as appropriate, ranging from 0 to 3, and a 5th level, the highest level of impairment, labeled \u201ctotal.\u201d However, not every facet has every level of severity. The Consciousness facet, for example, does not provide for an impairment level other than \u201ctotal,\u201d since any level of impaired consciousness would be totally disabling. Assign a 100-percent evaluation if \u201ctotal\u201d is the level of evaluation for one or more facets. If no facet is evaluated as \u201ctotal,\u201d assign the overall percentage evaluation based on the level of the highest facet as follows: 0 = 0 percent; 1 = 10 percent; 2 = 40 percent; and 3 = 70 percent. For example, assign a 70 percent evaluation if 3 is the highest level of evaluation for any facet.\n\n                \n\n                "
